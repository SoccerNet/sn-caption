Subscribe (watch) the repo to receive the latest info regarding timeline and prizes!

We propose the SoccerNet challenges to encourage the development of state-of-the-art algorithm for Soccer Video Understanding.

 - **Dense Video Captioning**: Generate coherent caption describing soccer actions occured and localizing each caption by a timestamp.

We provide an [evaluation server](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/2199/overview) for the Dense Video Captioning task. 
The evaluation server handles predictions for the open **test** sets and the segregated **challenge** sets of each challenge.

Winners will be announced at CVSports Workshop at CVPR 2024. 
Prizes and sponsors will be announced soon, stay tuned!
