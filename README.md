## How to download the dataset

A [SoccerNet pip package](https://pypi.org/project/SoccerNet/) to easily download the data and the annotations is available. 

To install the pip package simply run:

<code>pip install SoccerNet</code>

Then use the API to downlaod the data of interest including annotations and features at 2fps:

```
from SoccerNet.Downloader import SoccerNetDownloader as SNdl
mySNdl = SNdl(LocalDirectory="path/to/SoccerNet")
mySNdl.downloadDataTask(task="caption-2023", split=["train","valid", "test","challenge"])
```

If you want to download the videos, you will need to fill a [NDA](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfYFqjZNm4IgwGnyJXDPk2Ko_lZcbVtYX73w5lf6din5nxfmA/viewform) to get the password.

```
mySoccerNetDownloader.password = input("Password for videos?:\n")
mySoccerNetDownloader.downloadGames(files=["1_224p.mkv", "2_224p.mkv"], split=["train","valid","test","challenge"])
mySoccerNetDownloader.downloadGames(files=["1_720p.mkv", "2_720p.mkv", "video.ini"], split=["train","valid","test","challenge"])
```
